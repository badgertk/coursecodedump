Connecting to BlueHive can be done using a command line SSH client such as MobaXTerm or a graphical user interface SSH client such as X2Go.  Files can be transfered on MobaXTerm using the file directory functionality on the left hand side or using a program such as WinSCP.  For the purposes of this project, the text editor used was Notepad++ and Gedit (?).  The CPU code was written in C and was compiled with gcc.  The CUDA GPU code was written in CUDA and was compiled with nvcc.  The OpenCL GPU code was written in C++ and OpenCL.  The following modules need to be loaded before compilation: gtk, opencv, cuda, gcc/4.7.2.

salloc -t 5 -A ece406 -p ece406 --gres=gpu:1 srun


CPU Program:
Uses pthreads to divide work
Requires the use of accompanying ImageStuff.h and ImageStuff.c to setup RGB pixel values.

CUDA Program:
Launches Kernels in Threads and Blocks

OpenCL Program: 
Creates Device Contexts with Command Queues.
Command Queues are populated by compiled instructions. (can be out of order)
Compiles .cl file at runtime
